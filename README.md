Shapes or parts of shapes that fall outside the current page size are simply not drawn

A shape can either belong to a page or possessions area (in which case it does not belong to any particular page). How are we representing this?

Need to add function to resize or move shape (change parameters of Point object).

Error checking for missing files. Display grey rectangle if image not found.
Add ENUM types for whether rect, shape, or text.
